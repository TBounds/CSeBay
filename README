## Goals ##
###########
    * Display previous bids for each auction and relevant information.
        - name of bidder
        - time of bid
        - price of bid
    * Should not accept bids from users that don't exist?
        - I think we can interpret this as no user, since we don't have an account/user creation function.
        - Steve's idea: have predefined users in a table to compare against when making a bid

## Bugs ##
##########
    * Refreshing the bid page after making a bid resubmits the bid without any checking.
        - This effectively duplicates the last bid in the database.
        - No plan to fix as of yet.
